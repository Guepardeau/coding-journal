        <ul>
            <li><p>In the AM, I finished learning command line basics and getting to grips with the terminal. I downloaded <em>Warp</em>, a modern terminal that comes with many shortcuts and a nice GUI. I found it useful. Afterwards, I went through an introduction of <strong>git</strong> and the basic commands associated with adding and committing my code to GitHub. I feel I have a decent beginner's grasp and I'm now comfortable with setting up my own local dev environment.</p></li>
            <li><p>Currently, I'm going through an introduction to HTML & CSS and I found it appropriate to get a little practise by creating a HTML Journal of mine that I can perhaps update on my journey learning to code every once in a while. Maybe there is some way to implement this into my portfolio in the near future?</p></li>
